# My Dotfile collection

In this repository I collect and version the dotfiles I use on my different machines. There are thousands of dotfile repositories on GitHub already, but this is mine.
Most of the things found here are either stolen from friends and [/r/unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn) or the result of hours of configuration frenzy.
I should also add that some of the oldest config blobs in this repo date back to 2015 when I was just starting out with this. So don't expect too much.

Feel free to re-use and copy this if something catches your eye!

## Organization
